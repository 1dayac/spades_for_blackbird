This is a support software release for metaplasmidSPAdes publication

It consists of script for plasmid assembly from metagenomes  (./assembler/metaplasmidspades.py) and putative plasmid verification script (./assembler/src/plasmid_utils/plasmidverify.py)
Additionally we provide a plasmidSPAdes+ script (./assembler/plasmidspades_plus.py) that combines plasmidSPAdes (on default settings) with plasmid verification script

Installation and input/output options of first are same as in regular SPAdes -- see http://cab.spbu.ru/files/release3.13.0/manual.html for details

Second script has it's own README file ./assembler/src/plasmid_utils/plasmidverify_README.md
