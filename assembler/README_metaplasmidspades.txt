metaplasmidSPAdes can be run by either ./metaplasmidspades.py or by ./spades.py with options --meta and --plasmid
All ./spades configuration options for input/output should work. However, no testing for multiple libraries was performed
Potential plasmid verification script can be found at src/plasmid_utils/plasmidverify.py , with it's own README file src/plasmid_utils/plasmidverify_README.md
