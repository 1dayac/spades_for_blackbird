Incorporate this into banded alignment for finishing gaps 


1. The program crashes when the last nucleotide aligns. Fix that.

Done:
2. Investigate why there are so many (near) vertical alignments.
   - This is happening when a sequence with a gap is aligned 
     against a sequence without a gap.  Often what happens is the 
     alignment fed into FindBetweenProbes has a decent alignment in
     the beginning and end of the sequence, and junk in the middle.  
     An example of this is:
          288 776 8 5 0 1
          aligning single sequence of length: 288

   - This was solved by modifying the align gaps procedure, and merging
   aligngaps into a modified alignstrips (since the code was more or less 
   duplcated between the two anyway).  Basically, when aligning strips, each 
   strip is recursively aligned inside the strip.  When aligning gaps, each 
   shared k-mer is considered a strip, and alignment is performed between 
   strips.  Since some of the mapped k-mers are out of order (after a recursve 
   alignment), an ordered set may be selected using some filtration procedure 
   (LIS is used over removing out-of-order strips since this is a relaxed 
   assumption).  This produced a very clean alignment 
   (file human.mouse.10k.aln.fri.2) on large-scale, with few off-diagonal matches.	
   Two problems remain with this alignment technique:
     1. It is now very sparse between clusters of aligned nucleotides.  Find out why. 
     2. Some densly aligned regions have more than one well-aligned diagonal that is 
     made of two interleaving diagonals.


3. The first tuple of every alignment when aligning gaps ( lines
   1740-1773) is -1.  Need to find out why this is. (specifically
   why it is always negative). 
    - Possibly when a sequence is already aligned against it's 
      reverse complement.
    - This is only the observation for a few matches.  The reasons 
    stated previously was true.
