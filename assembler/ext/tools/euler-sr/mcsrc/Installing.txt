You must set the following environment variables to configure
(most) of the source:
MCSRC
MACHTYPE
LD_LIBRAR_PATH
GCC
PERL5LIB


To build, you need the environment variable MCSRC set to the source
tree directory, for example /home/mchaisso/projects/mcsrc .  Normally, 
if you are reading this file in the same directory as mcsrc, simply 
setenv MCSRC `pwd` is suffice.

MACHTYPE is set for most shells.  If you are running on a 64-bit
machine, this needs to be "x86_64".  If this is on a Mac, set MACHTYPE
to "powerpc".

You must also configure LD_LIBRARY_PATH to load the libraries that are
built and 
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${MCSRC}/lib/${MACHTYPE}.


For building subdirectories that require mysql, you must also set:
MYSQL_LIB_DIR - the location of libmysqlclient.so
MYSQL_INC_DIR - the location of the mysql include directory, for
example if it is /usr/include/mysql, MYSQL_INC_DIR should be
/usr/include.

(For error correction and assembly only, there is no need to configure mysql).

PERL5LIB should include ${MCSRC}/FwgLib:${MCSRC}/UTILS/



Each build auto-generates three files, make.dep, make.files, and
make.ofiles.
