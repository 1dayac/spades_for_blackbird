== For all audiences ==

To run ALLPATHS on your data with "run_allpaths.py" script you should prepare config file.
You can copy "config_template.txt" and modify it with your data.

Every line in config file is in format 
KEY_WORD VALUE ; COMMENTARY(optional)

The config should contain (in this order):
1. Reads of fragment library (KEY_WORD = frag_lib). The reads must be in fastq or fq format (and may be gzipped). 
Paired reads should be either in one file (interchanged) or in two files (you should use * and ? wildcard in VALUE in this case)
You can remove this line or left VALUE empty if you have no fragment library (but in this case you should set jumping library and 
contigs for simualtion -- see below).

2. Insert size of fragment library (KEY_WORD = insert_size). 
You should set this field even if you skipped the line with fragment library -- it is used for simulation.

3. Standart deviation of insert size of fragment library (KEY_WORD = stddev).
You should set this field even if you skipped the line with fragment library -- it is used for simulation.

4-6. Like first three lines but for jumping library.

7. Contigs for simulation (KEY_WORD = contigs_for_sim). You should set this field if you skipped either frag_lib or jump_lib.
This contigs will be used for simulating missing library with WGSim. Insert size and deviation are from appropriate lines of the config 
file (2-3 for fragment library and 5-6 for jumping library)

8. Ploidy of organism (KEY_WORD = ploidy). 
1 for haploid genomes (default value) and 2 for diploid ones. Don't change it if you are not sure.

9. Place where resulting should be saved (KEY_WORD = output_contigs). The parent directory will be also used for saving simulated library 
(if simulation was needed). Resulting scaffold will be saved with the same name as contigs but with suffix "_scaffold".


NOTE:
If you set both jumping and fragment library they should have same quality scale format (either phred+33 or phred+64). 
You can use third-party tools to convert from one format to another (e.g. Trimmomatic)


== For advanced users ==

The logs can be found:

1. ALLPATHS make log:
algorithmic-biology/assembler/build/ext/allpaths/make.log and make.err

These files will be APPENDED with new information every time you you run the script

2. WGSim's simulation logs (if was simulation)
algorithmic-biology/assembler/build/ext/allpaths/wgsim_src/sim.log and sim.err

These files will be OVERWRITTEN every time you run the script

3. ALLPATHS data preparation log:
algorithmic-biology/assembler/build/ext/allpaths/temp/prepare.log and prepare.err

These files will be OVERWRITTEN every time you run the script

4. ALLPATHS assembling log:
algorithmic-biology/assembler/build/ext/allpaths/temp/assemble.log and assemble.err

These files will be OVERWRITTEN every time you run the script

5. internal ALLPATHS' logs:
algorithmic-biology/assembler/build/ext/allpaths/temp/genome/make_log/data/run/test/*

There are separate folders for every run (titled with date and time).
