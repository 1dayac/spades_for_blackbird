abstract={For the last 20 years, fragment assembly in DNA sequencing
followed the “overlap-layout-consensus” paradigm that is used in all
currently available assembly tools. Although this approach proved useful
in assembling clones, it faces difficulties in genomic shotgun assembly.
We abandon the classical “overlap-layout-consensus” approach in favor of
a new euler algorithm that, for the first time, resolves the 20-year-old
“repeat problem” in fragment assembly. Our main result is the reduction
of the fragment assembly to a variation of the classical Eulerian path
problem that allows one to generate accurate solutions of large-scale
sequencing problems. euler, in contrast to the celera assembler, does not
mask such repeats but uses them instead as a powerful fragment assembly
tool.},
