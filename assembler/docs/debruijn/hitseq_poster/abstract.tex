%Dear Colleagues,
%
%Thank you for registering to attend HiTSeq 2011. We already have >200
%registrants we are looking forward to a successful meeting in Vienna
%next month. HiTSeq will feature a poster session (with refreshments
%sponsored by Ion Torrent) with posters targeting topics of immediate
%relevance to High Throughput Sequencing. A similar poster session last
%year was a big success, and we are hoping that many of the HiTSeq
%attendees will use this opportunity to present their work to their
%colleagues and to network. We have opened an additional call for
%late-breaking posters for all HiTSeq attendees. Please submit
%abstracts via e-mail to hitseq2011@cs.toronto.edu in MS Word or plain
%text format by June 30th for inclusion in the conference abstract
%book.
%
%We look forward to seeing you in Vienna!
