  abstract = {Whole genome amplification by the multiple displacement amplification
(MDA) method allows sequencing of DNA from single cells of bacteria
that cannot be cultured. Assembling a genome is challenging, however,
because MDA generates highly nonuniform coverage of the genome.
Here we describe an algorithm tailored for short-read data from
single cells that improves assembly through the use of a progressively
increasing coverage cutoff. Assembly of reads from single Escherichia
coli and Staphylococcus aureus cells captures >91\% of genes within
contigs, approaching the 95\% captured from an assembly based
on many E. coli cells. We apply this method to assemble a genome
from a single cell of an uncultivated SAR324 clade of Deltaproteobacteria,
a cosmopolitan bacterial lineage in the global ocean. Metabolic
reconstruction suggests that SAR324 is aerobic, motile and chemotaxic.
Our approach enables acquisition of genome assemblies for individual
uncultivated bacteria using only short reads, providing cell-specific
genetic information absent from metagenomic studies.}

to culturing organisms as a prerequisite for genomic sequencing.
The microgram amounts of DNA required as template are amplified
from a single bacterium by a method called multiple displacement
amplification (MDA) avoiding the need to grow cells. The ability
to sequence DNA from individual cells will likely have an immense
impact on microbiology considering the vast numbers of novel organisms,
which have been inaccessible unless culture-independent methods
could be used. However, special approaches have been necessary
to work with amplified DNA. MDA may not recover the entire genome
from the single copy present in most bacteria. Also, some sequence
rearrangements can occur during the DNA amplification reaction.
Over the past two years many research groups have begun to use
MDA, and some practical approaches to single-cell sequencing have
been developed. We review the consensus that is emerging on optimum
methods, reliability of amplified template, and the proper interpretation
of 'composite' genomes which result from the necessity of combining
data from several single-cell MDA reactions in order to complete
the assembly. Preferred laboratory methods are considered on the
basis of experience at several large sequencing centers where
>70\% of genomes are now often recovered from single cells. Methods
are reviewed for preparation of bacterial fractions from environmental
samples, single-cell isolation, DNA amplification by MDA, and
DNA sequencing.}

    abstract = {<sec>          <title>Background</title>          <p>Genomics studies are being revolutionized by the next generation sequencing technologies, which have made whole genome sequencing much more accessible to the average researcher. Whole genome sequencing with the new technologies is a developing art that, despite the large volumes of data that can be produced, may still fail to provide a clear and thorough map of a genome. The Plantagora project was conceived to address specifically the gap between having the technical tools for genome sequencing and knowing precisely the best way to use them.</p>        </sec>        <sec>          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>          <p>For Plantagora, a platform was created for generating simulated reads from several different plant genomes of different sizes. The resulting read files mimicked either 454 or Illumina reads, with varying paired end spacing. Thousands of datasets of reads were created, most derived from our primary model genome, rice chromosome one. All reads were assembled with different software assemblers, including Newbler, Abyss, and SOAPdenovo, and the resulting assemblies were evaluated by an extensive battery of metrics chosen for these studies. The metrics included both statistics of the assembly sequences and fidelity-related measures derived by alignment of the assemblies to the original genome source for the reads. The results were presented in a website, which includes a data graphing tool, all created to help the user compare rapidly the feasibility and effectiveness of different sequencing and assembly strategies prior to testing an approach in the lab. Some of our own conclusions regarding the different strategies were also recorded on the website.</p>        </sec>        <sec>          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>          <p>Plantagora provides a substantial body of information for comparing different approaches to sequencing a plant genome, and some conclusions regarding some of the specific approaches. Plantagora also provides a platform of metrics and tools for studying the process of sequencing and assembly further.</p>        </sec>},
